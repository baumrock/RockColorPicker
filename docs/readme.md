# RockColorPicker

A super simple color picker for the ProcessWire backend that can not only pick colors but also custom HTML (so you can use it for picking gradients, for example).

On non-required fields the selected color can be unselected by clicking the color again. The module also supports selecting colors via keyboard input (tab to focus color and then space/enter to select/unselect).
